I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a> and a former MS-Research student of <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIITH</a>.
Since I am into programming, you can safely assume I spend most of my time copying code from stack overflow and then trying to figure out what went wrong. I often go by the handle ‘padfoot7’. 
<br>

Apart from that, I am an avid reader and spend my free time reading about psychology, life, history, and poetry. I have a special place in my heart for Urdu poets, and I adore their works. Here is a nugget for you to feast upon:

<blockquote class="blockquote text-muted text-monospace" style="font-size:15px">
  Kiya Mein Ne Uss Khakdan Se Kinara<br>
  Jahan Rizq Ka naam Hai Aab-o-Dana<br>
  Bayaban Ki Khalwat Khush Ati Hai Mujh Ko<br>
  Azal Se Hai Fitrat Meri Rahbana<br>

  <br>
  (I have turned away from that place on earth<br>
  Where sustenance takes the form of grain and water.<br>
  The solitude of the wilderness pleases me<br>
  By nature I was always a dervish.)<br>
  <br>
  --- Allama Iqbal
